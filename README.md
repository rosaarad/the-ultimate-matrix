In this question you are given n matrices (m√óm). You must first sort the n matrices according to the value of their determinants and in ascending order; 
Pay attention that if the determinants of two matrices are equal, put the matrix that came earlier in the input first.
Also in the question of three numbers x and y and z are given. 
After sorting, you should transpose the matrix x, multiply with matrix y, and then add it with the inverse of the matrix z.
Your program should print the sum of the terms of the final matrix to three decimal places.
